  <section>
    <p>Welcome to my academic portfolio. I’m <strong>Tongshu Wu</strong>, a Computer Science Engineering undergraduate at <strong>Lehigh University</strong> with a minor in Data Science. My academic and research journey is grounded in a deep curiosity about intelligent systems and a commitment to advancing <strong>swarm robotics</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> for real-world impact.</p>

    <p>I currently serve as a <strong>Research Assistant</strong> at Lehigh's Swarm Lab, where I develop autonomous aerial systems with applications in transportation and collaborative object manipulation. My work spans hardware design, control systems, and algorithm development, and has contributed to a forthcoming <em>IEEE T-RO</em> publication.</p>

    <p>In industry, I’ve applied my skills in machine learning and data classification at <strong>WAYHO Technology</strong>, working with hyperspectral imagery to support law enforcement. These experiences have sharpened my ability to translate research into practical tools — a perspective I carry into all my projects.</p>

    <p>This site serves as a gateway to my <a href="resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>, <a href="#projects">projects</a>, <a href="#publications">publications</a>, and ongoing research. I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to collaborative, innovation-driven research teams at the PhD level.</p>
